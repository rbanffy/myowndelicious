My Very Own Delicious Clone
===========================

This is an unambitious attempt at preserving user bookmarks from delicious 
servers before Yahoo shuts down the system. It should run on top of Google's 
App Engine (I know - it may also be shut down in the future) and should be 
able to import Delicious bookmarks (even grab them itself, if the user gives
this app their password - and that's one reason why this application is
open-source: the user must be able to deploy it on his own GAE instance).
